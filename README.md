A collection of 10,000 nutty NFTs - they are unique digital collectibles that are exploring nodes and bytes on the Ethereum blockchain.

## üöß Work In Progress
This project is currently a work in progress. The artworks on the website are not temporary and are not the actual NFTs from this collection.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è About us

When you invest in our collection, you are not sold the average static JPEG by every instagram hustler today. We are offering you access to a metaphysical space pod to be a part of our intergalactic club of Astronutters.

Everything and anything that we venture into in the future will be a part of these perks and can be seamlessly activated by roadmap activation.
